# Project "ArcanoidDemo"

Greetings to everyone following my project! This project is my training ground for video game development on Unreal Engine. I aimed to learn C++ for Unreal Engine, so I chose a fairly simple game to gradually navigate the challenging path of shaping the right mindset as a C++ Gameplay Developer.

## Project Description:
This project is focused on creating an arcade game in the style of Arkanoid. The choice of this genre is driven by the desire to master the fundamentals of game development and improve programming skills. I'm not inventing something new; I'm implementing what I've seen and know how it should work. This makes it easier to control the outcome.

## Graphic Style:
The project includes two interesting shaders: Tune Shader and Outliner. These shaders provide flexible visual style settings, helping create a bright and memorable appearance for the future game. I created them following lessons from various authors, combining the properties I needed.

## Blueprints:
Several blueprints, such as "Ball," are already implemented in the project. These elements are currently used for testing purposes but will play a significant role in the project's future development, and their logic will be transferred to C++.

## C++ Implemented Components:

### BlockBase Class:
Defines the fundamental characteristics of blocks in the game and has a set of methods for gameplay implementation.

### BlockLayoutController Class:
A tool for game designers, providing the ability to quickly place blocks in the level. It also manages blocks during gameplay, ensuring dynamic interaction with other elements.

## Progress and Perspectives:
Progress in development is not as fast as desired, as I work on the project in my free time outside of my main job. However, each step brings new experience and skills, making this process engaging and productive.
